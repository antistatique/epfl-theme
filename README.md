Epfl theme (Wordpress)
===
 * Based on [*_s* theme (underscores)](https://underscores.me/)
 * Implements the [elements](https://github.com/epfl-idevelop/elements) styleguide
 * Uses shortcodes to display special content served by EPFL APIs.

## Requirements
  * production build of [elements](https://github.com/epfl-idevelop/elements) located in `/assets`
  * composer

## Setup
  1. `$ composer install`
  2. Nothing more, you're ready to go! ðŸš€

## Shortcodes
Each shortcode has its own subfoler in the `shortcodes/` directory, placed at the root of the template.

The `_load.php` automatically loads all files named `controller.php` in all subfolders.

  ```
  â”œâ”€â”€ shortcodes/
  |   â”œâ”€â”€ _load.php
  |   â”œâ”€â”€ [shortcode-slug]/
  |       â”œâ”€â”€ controller.php
  |       â””â”€â”€ view.php
  â””â”€â”€ â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```
file|role
